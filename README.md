# php-task-manager1.0

A simple php task manager with crud and Registration/Login

## Version 1.3 Tech used UI - Bootstrap 5 
## Backend - MySql 
## Middleware - PHP 
## hosted locally with Apache (Xampp)

Can Perform Simple Crud Operations Like Add,Update,Delete and Show tasks, Used Php Sessions for better user management with login and logout

### UPDATE
used the isset function, as anyone could access the files, through url and modify through url, dont want that so now, without login, accessing home.php through url isnt possible.
will prolly meet again, if i found something like this.

### if any queries or suggestions or errors plz contact me @ linkedin : Mithil Dhure

Feel Free to use or modify!!
