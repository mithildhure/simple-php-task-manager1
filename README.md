### Home Page
![Home Page](c:\Users\Lenovo\Pictures\task_manager\t_home.png "Home")

### UPDATE
used the ***isset function***, as anyone could access the files, through url and modify through url, dont want that so now, without login, accessing home.php through url isnt possible,
Also changed the ***update.php***, now you can update only what u want to, as the form now contains value of update query so u dont have to remember everything lolz.

#### Imp
new update, will come soon thatll be the **v2.0**, a bigger update, will add new column, and also some useful functions, stay tuned.
