# php-task-manager1.0

A simple php task manager with crud and Registration/Login

## Version 1.5 Tech used UI - Bootstrap 5 
## Backend - MySql 
## Middleware - PHP 
## hosted locally with Apache (Xampp)

Can Perform Simple Crud Operations Like Add,Update,Delete and Show tasks, Used Php Sessions for better user management with login and logout

### UPDATE
used the ***isset function***, as anyone could access the files, through url and modify through url, dont want that so now, without login, accessing home.php through url isnt possible,
Also changed the ***update.php***, now you can update only what u want to, as the form now contains value of update query so u dont have to remember everything lolz.

#### Imp
new update, will come soon thatll be the **v2.0**, a bigger update, will add new column, and also some useful functions, stay tuned.
